# Visionizer
An open-source engine developed by the Visionizer-team.

## Getting started
Since there are no releases yet, you have to clone the project and build it using your Visual Studio.
We recommend that you use Visual Studio 2019 and Windows since this engine has not been tested in any other environements.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/visionizerengine/visionizer`.
If you are reading this after cloning it non-recursively, use `git submodule add --init` to clone all of the submodules

After successfully cloning the project, please run the "GenerateProjects.bat" file which will execute a premake script, that will generate a Solution.
