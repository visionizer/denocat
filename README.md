# Visionizer Engine

Visionizer is a game engine developed using C++. It is currently in a very immature state.

## Getting Started

Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Visionizer is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/visionizertechnologies/visionizer`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
